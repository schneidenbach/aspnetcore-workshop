# ASP.NET Core Workshop

## Overview

This is Spencer's fork of the repository created by Jon Galloway and Damian Edwards (and others) which condenses the two-day workshop into one.  For more reading and practice, I recommend poking around the original repo, which you can find [here](https://github.com/jongalloway/aspnetcore-workshop).
